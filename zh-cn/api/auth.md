# Steedos API 身份验证

**Warning: Make sure you're using HTTPS, otherwise this is insecure!**

### Personal Access Token

#### Logging In


```bash 
curl https://cn.steedos.com/api/setup/login -d "username=test&password=password"
```

And the response will look like
```javascript
{ status: "success", data: {authToken: "f2KpRW7KeN9aPmjSZ", userId: fbdpsNf4oHiX79vMJ} }
```

You'll need to save the `userId` and `token` on the client, for subsequent authenticated requests.

#### Logging Out
  
You also have an authenticated `POST /api/logout` endpoint for logging a user out. If successful, the
auth token that is passed in the request header will be invalidated (removed from the user account),
so it will not work in any subsequent requests.
```bash
curl https://cn.steedos.com/api/setup/logout -X POST -H "X-Auth-Token: f2KpRW7KeN9aPmjSZ" -H "X-User-Id: fbdpsNf4oHiX79vMJ"
```

#### Authenticated Calls

For any endpoints that require the default authentication, you must include the `userId` and
`authToken` with each request under the following headers:
- X-User-Id
- X-Auth-Token

```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: f2KpRW7KeN9aPmjSZ" -H "X-User-Id: fbdpsNf4oHiX79vMJ" https://cn.steedos.com/api/organizations/
```

## Request and Response Structure

All responses generated by Steedos follow the [JSend] format, with one minor tweak: failures have
an identical structure to errors. Successful responses will have a status code of `200`, unless 
otherwise indicated. Sample requests and responses for each endpoint are included below:
